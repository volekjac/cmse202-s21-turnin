    "**&#9989; Question 15 [10 points]:** In order to simplify the process of \"observing\" the nebula that's we've been looking at thus far, you're going to build the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `load_images` function that takes two image filenames as inputs, loads the  corresponding FITS files, and returns a **dictionary** where the keys in the dictionary are the filenames and the entries in the dictionary are the corresponding image arrays.\n",
    "2. A `calc_stats` function that takes a dictionary of image information (like the one returned by your `load_images` function) as input and **prints the mean and standard deviation of all images in the dictionary**. Make sure that the print statements indicate which image the values correspond to by using the filenames that are stored in the dictionary.\n",
    "3. A `make_composite` function that takes your two filenames and your dictionary of image information as input and creates a 3D NumPy array that represents a 2D image and it's corresponding \"R\" \"G\" and \"B\" values. The Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) channels should be defined in the following ways:\n",
    "    1. The red channel should be defined as\n",
    "    $$ 1.5 \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{I~filter~image~array}}{\\mathrm{The~maximum~of~the~R~filter~image~array}}$$\n",
    "    2. The green channel should be based on the average pixels values, speficially defined as\n",
    "    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{(I~filter~image~array + R~filter~image~array)/2}}{\\mathrm{The~maximum~of~the~R~filter~image~array}}$$\n",
    "    3. The blue channel should be defined as\n",
    "    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{R~filter~image~array}}{\\mathrm{The~maximum~of~the~R~filter~image~array}}$$\n",
    "    When this function is called it should **display the \"false color\" image you've created by using `plt.imshow()`** \n",
    "    \n",
    "**A starter function and the code for creating the red channel has been provided for you for the `make_composite` function!**\n",
    "    \n",
    "For the `make_composite` function, you may run into issues with some of your image data values not being of the correct type to do the some of math necessary to make the composite image, so you may need to convert some of the values to the appropriate type. Also, make sure you understand what the provided code is doing, especially when it comes to \"clipping\" the RGB values!"
