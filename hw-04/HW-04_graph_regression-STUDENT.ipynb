    "\n",
    "In many applications, we want to simulate the dynamics based on the graph topology, i.e. how do neighbors in the network communicate information with each other. For example, if a couple of individuals in the social network happen to know a rumor first and then the rumor starts to be spread to others by emails, how quickly will the rumor spread to everyone? And which groups of individuals will know the rumor early?\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Three individuals know the rumor first. They are node 15, node 22, and node 27 (0-based node index). Therefore, these 3 nodes are considered as the 'seed' of rumor in the graph.\n",
    "An 'rumor value' array can be created to label the nodes. For example, the 3 seed nodes are labeled as '1' at the beginning ('1' means they know the rumor for sure 100%), and all other nodes are labeled as '0' at the beginning ('0' means they are totally unaware of the rumor).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You write a for loop to do the simulation, where each step in the loop represent a specific time point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At each time point, the rumor value for every node is updated, based on the rumor values of their neighbors in the graph, because if many neighbors know the rumor it is very likely the individual will be informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each node will notify its neighbors with a probability that is inversely proportional to its degree. The more neighbors, the less likely that the node will send the rumor to one of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For example, if node A has two neighbors: B and C. Node B has a degree of 3 and node C has a degree of 5. Then the rumor value of node A for the next iteration should be updated as: new_value(A) = value(B)/3 +value(C)/5\n",

    "&#9989; **Question 3.3:** As you likely found in the previous question, the pages with very few links do not conform to the powerlaw description of scale-free graphs. We are interested in understanding the power-law part of the data and thus we can remove the initial data that is outside the powerlaw regime. Remove the initial part and refit the power-law $f(x)\\mapsto x^{-1}$. How well does this fit the data? **Again, make sure you visual your new best-fit model along with the data.**"

    "&#9989; **Question 3.4: (15 points)** Maybe the data can be better described with multiple powerlaws (i.e. a sum of different powerlaws; $f(x)\\mapsto \\sum_0^n a_i x^{-i}$). Try adding powerlaw terms together up to a power of 10 and track the evolution of adjusted R squared (`statsmodels` provides this value after you make the fit). To aid your analysis of the results, make two plots:\n",
    "1) with data and models (for all models)\n",
